    <h1>Exploring Pittsburgh Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to establish some basic cultural zones.</p>
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <p>Pittsburgh's culture is very much shaped by the inhabitants of its numerous neighborhoods.</p>
    <h2>Neighborhoods</h2>

<p>These are the various neighborhoods I would focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hazelwood</li>
  <li>Hill District</li>
  <li>Homewood</li>
  <li>Lawrenceville</li>
  <li>North Side</li>
  <li>Oakland</li>
  <li>South Side</li>
  <li>Squirrel Hill</li>
  <li>West End</li>
</ul>
<p>Cultural features I would hope to focus on would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Art Installations</li>
  <li>Architectural Features</li>
  <li>Music Performances</li>
  <li>Unique Cuisine Options</li>
</ol>
<h2>Basic Submission Suggestions</h2>

<p><em>Culture</em>, as you may know, is everything that surrounds you that makes a space unique to those that dwell within it.</p>
<p>The easiest and most accessible way to present these distinct cultural elements is through the use of <strong>photography</strong>, as everyone with a phone can be alerted immediately.</p>
<p><em><strong>And everyone has a phone!</strong></em></p>
<h2>Collaborative Nature</h2>

<p>I see no issue with the functionality of this webpage relying soley on the contributions from well renowned photographers throughout the city, as well as the everyday civilian that notices something <strong>amazing</strong> happening right in front of them. The more people contribute to exposing the culutural richness of this city, the easier it will be for us all to live harmoniously within the same city limits.</p>

<p>Ever consumed with hope,<br/>
